## Introduction to SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym that represents the following principles:

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**: Open-closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- The SOLID principles encourage modular, loosely-coupled, and well-organized code.

## Principle 1: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have a single responsibility or job within the system. This principle encourages the separation of concerns and helps prevent code bloat and tangled dependencies.

## Principle 2: Open-Closed Principle (OSP)

The OSP suggests that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you can add new features or behaviors without altering existing code. By adhering to this principle, your codebase becomes more adaptable and less prone to regressions.

## Principle 3: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The LSP emphasizes that objects of a derived class should be able to replace objects of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program. This principle ensures that polymorphism is properly implemented and that derived classes are true extensions of their base classes.

## Principle 4: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The ISP advocates for small, focused interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones. Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle promotes modularity and prevents the introduction of unnecessary dependencies.

## Principle 5: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The DIP asserts that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This principle encourages the use of dependency injection and facilitates the decoupling of components.
